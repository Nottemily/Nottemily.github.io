I am a graphic designer with a special interest in branding and motion graphics but I am eager to play and learn in all aspects of design. My home base is currently Bellingham, WA as I work to complete my BFA in Design at Western Washington University. At my roots, I am not just a designer, but also an artist, painter, and photographer. Believe me, there was not a time in my life when I wasn't taking an art class. On my on-creative side, I enjoy baking, traveling, and quading on the Oregon Sand Dunes.
